# Whatsapp-Bomb
It's a simple whatsapp text bomb written in Python with Selenium module.

##Motivation :
I had paid for the broadband service to the contractor, but the person was not replying to neither calls nor messages for 2 weeks. At this point I thought it was fraud. So I decided to use text bomb to get his attention. It paid off, he dropped all his work that day and gave us broadband connection.


This program runs on Google Chrome.

## To Run:
python whatsapp_bomb.py

Multiple messages can also be sent by creating an array and random function in python.
